## Recommended Developer software

In order to most efficiently work with this code base, we recommend having a workstation with the following software:

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - VS Code Plugins:
    - **MarkdownLint** (To make sure markdown files adhere to syntax best practice)
    - **PowerShell**
    - **Markdown All in One** (Or any other markdown previewer)
    - **GitLens** (Allows for more advanced git operations within the VS Code GUI - such as comparing branches and viewing git history)
    - **Draw.IO Integration** (We use Draw.IO for our drawings, this plugin allows to open and edit these files directly in VS Code. It is also possible to open these files outside of VS code, so this plugin is just for in-program edits)
    - **Azure Pipelines** (Linter for Azure Pipelines YML syntax)
    - **Bicep** (Linter for Bicep files)
    - **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools** (Linter for ARM files)
    - **Code Spell Checker** (Or any other English dictionary extension which supports common programming casing)
    - **GitHub Copilot** (AI that can help you by suggesting code and entire functions in real time)
